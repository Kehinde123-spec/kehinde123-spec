## I am an engineer who became so fascinated by LLMs and decided to explore Machine Learning. Two years later, I am building ML models, learning even more fascinating concepts and hoping to pivot into ML/DS roles. 

Since my final year of my masters program I have:

Taken professional level courses in AI and Machine Learning at my university
Wrapped up my batch at Recurse Center
Completed ALX Africa Foundations Data Science Course
Build two end-to-end deep learning pipelines on two projects
