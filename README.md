## Hiya, I'm Kehinde 👋

I am an engineer who became so fascinated by LLMs and decided to explore Machine Learning. Two years later, I am building ML models, learning even more fascinating concepts and hoping to pivot into ML/DS roles. 

Since my final year of my masters program I have:

* Taken professional level courses in AI and Machine Learning at my university
* Wrapped up my batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)
* Completed [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Foundations Data Science Course 
* Build two end-to-end deep learning pipelines on two projects
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... ML based Statistics, while redescovering my love for Mathematics.
- 💬 Ask me about ... Central limit theorem. I've been learning about that for a few days now!
